# PDS analysis class


## Introduction

Here are my analysis class for the Photon Detectors data.
The data format has been changed in Feb. 2023. If you want to keep the old format, please checkout to the `old_format` branch. 
However, the codes will be not up to date.

If you have processed data in the old format and wish to change to the new one:
Just load the class (see below) and an option will come to change the data format (a backup file will be created automatically).


## How to use:

After cloning the repository, `cd` inside `./codes/` and run:

``` bash
source ./setup_codes.sh
```

This will create `templates` scripts to help you in your analysis. 

After doing so, in the file `load_my_class.sh` you will find instructions on how to setup an automatic loading of the class for "online" analysis. 

It will give you the instructions (**with the correct path**) as following:

``` example
# insert this line to .bashrc
# alias myclass="source ~/{YOUR_PATH}/load_my_class.sh"
# to use the sample (analyzer) class, go to any folder which have "analyzed.root" file and run:
# myclass
# If you want to execute a specific file instead, you can run
# myclass {path_to_file}/your_file.root 
# If you want to change old data, you need to give the number of points per waveform as following:
# myclass {file.root} {# of pts}
```


If everything works you can run `myclass` and it will load it.

To check a few methods, you can run:
``` root
s.sample_plot(4,"",16);
```

This will draw event `4` with TV1D denoise filter parameter equal `16`. 
If you have two or more channels, you can draw the event (`4`) in the same graph doing:

``` root
s.kch = 1
s.sample_plot(4,"SAME",16)
```

`kch` refer to the logical numbering of the channels. If you want to set it by name instead you can use, for example, `s.setChannel("Ch4.")`.


For this "online" plottings, the methods are located in `analyzer_plots.C` and `analyzer.C`.


This `ANALYZER` class gives a fast and simple way to write scripts and handle the data. 


### Most common scripts

The most common scripts used are:

``` example
adc_read_all_data.C # This process data, subtract baseline and save as .root
giveMeSphe.C        # script to get single photo-electron spectrum
fit_sphe_wave1.C    # script to fit the spectrum
```

To use the scripts, copy the templates to the folder you have your data (or to any place different than their original code). Set the parameters as needed.
Check the parameters carefully, if not clear, check their implementation in the codes `readingCodes.C` and `calibrationCodes.C`.
